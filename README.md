# Machine Learning Pipeline for the "load_iris" dataset available in the scikit-learn datasets module 

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning pipeline built with Python, leveraging popular libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas. The pipeline demonstrates the full process of data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, prediction and visualization using various classification algorithms.

Features:
1. Data Preprocessing: Implements feature scaling using StandardScaler to standardize data.
2. Model Selection: Supports multiple models - Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). 
3. Voting Classifier: Combines multiple models using soft voting to improve classification accuracy.
4. Pipeline Structure: Uses scikit-learn’s Pipeline to streamline the process from data preparation to model evaluation.
5. Performance Metrics: Evaluates model performance using accuracy_score and other metrics.
